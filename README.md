## CS50 Web  

In this folder, I have included all my projects related to learning programming and developing skills as part of the CS50 courses. These projects cover a wide range of topics and technologies that helped me understand and master both the basics and more advanced programming concepts.

I invite you to explore my programming journey and my projects!

### CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript 

As part of the **CS50 Web** course, I developed skills in building web applications, such as:

- **Frontend and backend development:** Creating dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and integrating with a backend using the Django framework.
- **Database management:** Designing and managing relational databases (SQLite) and implementing migrations.
- **APIs and user interfaces:** Creating and consuming APIs and building interactive user interfaces.

Example projects:

1. **Project 0: Search**  
   A simple search engine application, similar to Google.
   
2. **Project 1: Wiki**  
   A Wikipedia application that allows users to create and edit web pages, fully built with Django.

3. **Project 2: Commerce**  
   A marketplace application where users can list items for sale, bid on items, add them to favorites, and comment on selected auctions.

4. **Project 3: Mail**  
   A web-based email application that allows users to send, receive, and archive messages, with an interface similar to popular email platforms.

5. **Project 4: Network**  
   A social media application where users can create posts, like posts, and follow other users.

6. **Final Project: BookIT**  
   An interactive platform for listing and booking services, allowing users to book local services (e.g., barber, manicure) directly through the platform, with automatically generated available time slots.

### Technologies used during the courses:

- **Programming languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks:** Django, Bootstrap
- **Databases:** SQLite
- **Other:** HTML, CSS


### CS50x

As part of the CS50x course, I completed projects that spanned a wide range of topics and technologies. This course covered not only low-level programming in C but also more advanced topics such as SQL, Flask, JavaScript, and CSS. Here are some of the key areas I explored:

- **Algorithms and data structures,**
- **Web development:** Using Flask as a lightweight web framework for creating web applications, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building dynamic, responsive front-end interfaces.
- **Databases:** Working with SQL to create, query, and manipulate databases, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

Example projects:

1. **Filter:** A project for image processing (e.g., blurring, grayscale conversion).
2. **Cash:** A program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to give a specific amount of change, using a greedy algorithm.
3. **Caesar:** A program that encrypts text using the Caesar cipher.
4. **Recover:** A tool for recovering deleted images from binary files by identifying JPEG headers and reconstructing the images.

5. **Finance:** A web application that simulates stock trading, using Flask for the backend, SQLite for the database, and

### CS50 Python

The **CS50 Python** course allowed me to delve into advanced programming concepts in Python. The projects I worked on helped me develop skills such as:

- **File handling and functions:** Creating scripts that automate tasks and process data.
- **Testing and debugging:** Writing unit tests and handling exceptions to improve code reliability.
- **Object-oriented modeling:** Using classes and objects to solve real-world problems.

Example projects:

1. **Tip Calculator:** An application to calculate the tip based on the bill amount and percentage.

2. **Fuel Gauge:** A program that calculates the fuel level in the tank based on user input.
3. **Bitcoin Price Index:** An application that fetches the current Bitcoin price from an API and displays the result to the user.
