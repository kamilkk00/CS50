# CS50x Projects

This repository contains all the projects I completed during the **CS50x** course. Throughout this course, I explored fundamental and advanced concepts in computer science, working with various languages and technologies, including C, Python, SQL, and Flask.

## Topics Covered

0. **Scratch**: The course begins with an introduction to programming using Scratch, a visual programming language designed to teach computational thinking.  
1. **C**: Moving to C, I learned low-level programming, understanding how memory works and practicing efficient resource management.  
2. **Arrays**: I worked on storing and manipulating data using arrays, understanding how to efficiently work with sequential collections of data.  
3. **Algorithms**: Focused on optimizing programs by implementing sorting and searching algorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort, and binary search.  
4. **Memory**: Covered memory management techniques, including dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and freeing memory to prevent leaks.  
5. **Data Structures**: Explored data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, stacks, and queues to store and organize data effectively.  
6. **Python**: Delved into high-level programming in Python, learning to write cleaner, faster code with built-in libraries and tools.  
7. **Artificial Intelligence**: Gained a brief introduction to AI concepts and implemented basic AI techniques such as search algorithms.  
8. **SQL**: Learned about relational databases and how to query data efficiently using SQL, covering joins, filtering, and aggregation.  
9. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Learned the basics of web development, building interactive websites and forms with HTML, styled with CSS, and enhanced with JavaScript.  
10. **Flask**: Developed dynamic web applications using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to manage routes and render HTML templates.  
11. **Cybersecurity**: Explored key cybersecurity concepts such as encryption, data security, and authentication mechanisms.
