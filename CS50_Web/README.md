**BookIT** is an interactive platform that allows users to book local services (such as haircuts, manicure) without needing a third-party intermediary. The platform generates time slots based on the service provider’s availability, allowing users to book directly from the website.

### Key Features:
- **User Registration and Profiles**: Both regular users and service providers can create accounts. Service providers can upgrade to a professional profile to offer their services.
- **Service Booking**: Users can view available services and book them in specific time slots.
- **Dynamic Time Slot Creation**: Service providers can specify working hours, and available time slots are generated automatically.
- **Review System**: Users can leave ratings and reviews for professional services.
- **Calendar Integration**: Users can view and manage their booked time slots, while service providers can track their appointments.
