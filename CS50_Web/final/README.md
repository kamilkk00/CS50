## Distincitveness:

BookIT is an interactive platform that allows users to book local services (such as a barber or manicure) without the presence of a third party and does not require direct contact with the service provider. 
The platform is particularly unique because it has an interactive form for creating services and automatically creates a calendar for a given service. Users can register for selected time slots at a time specified by the service provider.

## Complexity:  

The project consists of many functionalities, but the most important is the ability to register for the selected service without the intermediation of third parties and direct telephone contact with the service provider.

Each user can create their own service, all they need to do is upgrade their profile to a professional profile on a specially prepared form, then they can add the service they want to provide, the price of the service as well as the working hours in which the service provider provides the service and the duration of the service. Based on this information, BookIT creates both a website for the service provider and a page for a specific service with time slots where consumers can sign up.

Users have the option to find a specific service based on specific categories. Once they find the right service, they can check the available dates directly on the website and can also sign up for the service themselves. If users decide on a selected time slot on a given day, it disappears from the available ones, and the user can check all the services for which they have signed up with one click, and the service provider can check the dates for which customers have signed up together with the user's nickname.

BookIT allows to automatically create new slots for each day, so that the service provider does not have to reintroduce the service.

Dynamic appointment generation and automatic information about enrolled customers are the basis for the operation of the entire application.

BookIT uses a number of models such as user, Professional_User, service along with the time frame of work, on the basis of which the next model, i.e. avaliability, is created, along with information on the hours at which the service provider accepts for a given service and with information on how long the service lasts. On this basis, an interface for the user is created, and after signing up, the data is transferred to the platform using the Time_slot model.

BookIT also uses JavaScript when subscribing to the service in an interactive way along with feedback to the user, as well as JS is used to display messages that disappear after a certain period of time.
